A Pen created at CodePen.io. You can find this one at https://codepen.io/erinesullivan/pen/JvoBvq.

 A simple, responsive, and accessible sorting table using jQuery's Tablesorter plugin. HTML5 and CSS3. IE11 friendly.

This pen was originally inspired by Mickeychr's "Sea of Thieves Merchant cheatsheet." I may or may not have a Sea of Thieves addiction.
